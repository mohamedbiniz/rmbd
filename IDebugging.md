### Interactive ASP Debugger ###

The prototype of the interactive ASP debugger can be downloaded from this page because Google blocked publishing of binaries since mid January 2014.

  * [interactive-asp-1.0.jar](http://wiki.rmbd.googlecode.com/hg/other/interactive-asp-1.0.jar)

  * [example.lp](http://wiki.rmbd.googlecode.com/hg/other/example.lp)

  * [example-input.lp](http://wiki.rmbd.googlecode.com/hg/other/example-input.lp)

The program requires [Java 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index-jsp-138363.html) (or higher) and [clingo](http://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/clingo/) (version 4 or higher). The program is invoked by the following scheme:

`java -jar interactive-asp-1.0.jar --clingo=<path> [input-file]`

For example:

`java -jar interactive-asp-1.0.jar --clingo=c:\clingo.exe example-input.lp`

The input file (see example-input.lp for an example) includes 6 sections:
` [ASP], [BK], [CT], [CF], [BT], [BF] `


  * ASP section includes the meta-program output by spock tool. The program can be generated by invoking:
> ` java -jar spock.jar -mtr -mpr FILENAME `

> For instance: ` java -jar spock.jar -mtr -mpr example.lp `
  * BK section is a background knowledge which includes a comma separated list of identifiers of rules that are considered as correct. For instance: `[BK] r1, r5`

  * Other sections are used to specify the test cases. Each test case is defined on a separate line as a comma separated list of atoms of the original program. Depending on the type all atoms of a test case must be cautiously/bravely true/false in all interpretations that are not answer sets because of reasons suggested by a diagnosis. For instance, atoms `a` and `b` must be bravely true: `[BT]  a, b`


Additional options include:
  * `--scoring=[split|dynamic|minscore]` can be used to select a scoring function for query selection. "Minscore" (entropy-based function) is used by default.
  * `--estimator=[equal|simple]` select a fault probability estimator for diagnoses. "Equal" assigns an equal probability to each diagnosis, whereas "simple" prefers diagnoses including atoms over `unsatisfied/1` and `violated/1` predicates.
