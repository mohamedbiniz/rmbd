# Welcome to our wiki #

This wiki gives you a short overview how the code is organized and what is the purpose of the different modules.

The [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) Section is about how to use the code. It explains how to get started to write your own code using our diagnosis library.

The [Query Debugger Section](QuickStartGuide.md) gives an overview of our plugin for the Protege OWL editor.

The [Experiments Section](Experiments.md) gives you some information about the setups we used in our experiments. Here you can find also detailed tables with results which where too long to include in in our papers.

There is another section where you can find our [Publications](Publications.md) in this field.
